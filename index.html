Get Started
This is a quick guide to get started on Web WorldWind basics. This is what we’re going to build:

To do it, we’ll go over the following steps:

Loading and displaying a WorldWind globe
Setting up a development web server
Displaying some objects over the globe (placemarks and 3D shapes)
Displaying imagery from a 3rd party map service
Loading and displaying a WorldWind globe
There are multiple ways to load the Web WorldWind library. The simplest is to include a script tag in an HTML page to link it directly from WorldWind’s servers.

We can begin by creating a folder for our web application (say, ‘HelloWorldWind’). Within that folder, Let’s create a file named ‘index.html’ and add the following to it:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
    </head>
    <body>
        <canvas id="canvasOne" width="1024" height="768">
            Your browser does not support HTML5 Canvas.
        </canvas>
        <script 
        src="https://files.worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/artifactory/web/0.9.0/worldwind.min.js"
        type="text/javascript"></script>
        <script src="helloWorldWind.js" type="text/javascript">
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
As shown above, within your body section and above the script tags, a canvas is needed where you want your globe to be, defining its id, width and height. You also want to include a message for browsers that do not support HTML5 Canvas.

Now we’ll create our WorldWind globe through JavaScript. Within our project folder, we’ll create a ‘helloWorldWind.js’ file. In our JavaScript file, first we need to create a WorldWindow. The WorldWindow object binds all Web WorldWind functionality to an HTML canvas via its id, which as defined in our previous HTML is "canvasOne":

var wwd = new WorldWind.WorldWindow("canvasOne");
Now we can start manipulating our WorldWind instance through the WorldWindow. Let’s add some imagery layers:

wwd.addLayer(new WorldWind.BMNGOneImageLayer());
wwd.addLayer(new WorldWind.BMNGLandsatLayer());
The first layer is a locally sourced, very low resolution version of NASA’s Blue Marble, which it may be used as a ‘fallback’ if Web WorldWind is not able to request online imagery layers, such as the second one (Landsat imagery with higher resolution).

We will also add a compass, a coordinates display, and some view controls to the WorldWindow:

wwd.addLayer(new WorldWind.CompassLayer());
wwd.addLayer(new WorldWind.CoordinatesDisplayLayer(wwd));
wwd.addLayer(new WorldWind.ViewControlsLayer(wwd));
Note that in order for both the corresponding icons of these controls to be displayed, as well as the low resolution Blue Marble imagery, we need their image files to be sourced locally. These need to be inside an ‘./images’ directory which needs to be a sibling of the library, i.e. exist in the same directory (if following our convention, the folder should be ‘./HelloWorldWind/images’). The image files can be downloaded in here.

We have written a basic Web WorldWind app, but unlike the Java and Android versions of WorldWind, Web WorldWind is meant to be part of a web application, therefore we need a web server to visualize our work. If you’re not familiar with local testing servers, the Mozilla Development Network is a good place to start.

Serving your application
If you do not already have a web server, you can use a minimal development web server built in Node.js:

Download and install Node.
Open a command line console in the root folder of your web app (where the ‘index.html’ file and your ‘./images’ folder is located).
In the command line console, run npm install http-server.
Execute the command http-server to start the server.
In your web browsear, head to the address http://localhost/:8080.
Another option is to use Python’s http.server:

Download and install Python version 3.X.
Open a command line console in the root folder of your web app (where the ‘index.html’ file and your ‘./images’ folder is located).
In the command line console, run python -m http.server.
In your web browser, head to the address http://localhost/:8000.
In either case, you should see in your web browser a globe like this:

Our WorldWind globe so far
Now you have a WorldWind globe up an running in a local instance of a minimal web server. These are the contents of our web application up to this point:

index.html:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
</head>
<body>
    <canvas id="canvasOne" width="1024" height="768">
        Your browser does not support HTML5 Canvas.
    </canvas>
    <script src="https://files.worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/artifactory/web/0.9.0/worldwind.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="globe.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</body>
